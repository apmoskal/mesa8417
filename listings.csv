My property is near and dear to my heart as this was my grandparents home that I pretty much grew up in and that I bought after they passed away. I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!  You will enjoy staying here and all this city has to offer_ I will make sure of it!  :) 
 
Thank you and I look forward to meeting you!

You will enjoy the privacy of your space with your personal fridge in this Victorian-era house. Entry to the unit is through the main floor with a passcode lock.","Central Square is truly the center of everything that's happening in Cambridge. Located right in between Harvard Square and Kendall Square (MIT), it's walking distance to both institutions and all the research centers in the area. I used to bike from Harvard to MIT when I was a student, a very pleasant 15 minute ride. Harvard Street is just two streets north of Massachusetts Avenue, which is the main street that connects these school and also directly leads to downtown. A simple search shows that there're more than twenty 4-Star+ coffee shops and countless 4-Star+ restaurants, you can walk to restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, universities, just about everywhere.","Cambridge, MA","A world traveler trapped inside a body of an entrepreneur who wants to make the world a better place to live. This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.

Many startups have moved research and office operations into the Square to take advantage of the relatively low costs and the proximity to MIT. Nearly demolished in the 1950s, the neighborhood was spared and went so far as to experience a sort of renaissance. In 2012, the state of Massachusetts designated Central Square as an official Cultural District.","New York, NY","We’re Blueground, a global proptech company with several thousand move-in-ready apartments in a growing number of major cities around the world.
